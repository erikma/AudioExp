# AudioExp
Audio stream parsing experiments using Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) and machine learning.

## Training
See 'usage' section in TrainKerasTensorFlowForTaggedSounds.py

## Visualization
Compare waveform in amplitude domain to MFCCs graphically. See 'usage' section in PlotWav.py

## Finding samples in a .wav file
See AnalyzeSoundStream.py

## Debugging
See WavToMfccFeatures.py
